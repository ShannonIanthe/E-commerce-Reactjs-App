# E-commerce-Reactjs-App
This was my first time creating an app with React js <br>
I found Reactjs to be very helpful in regards to organization

<h1> Technologies / Libraries / Frameworks Used: </h1>
<ul>
<li> JavaScript
<li>REACTJS
<li>SCSS 
<li>SASS 
<li>Git 
  </ul>

<h1> Problems I faced </h1>
I am having trouble with the font awesome icons <br>
For some reason I am not able to make them appear on the navbar <br>
I think the font awesome link is placed in the wrong place <br>
